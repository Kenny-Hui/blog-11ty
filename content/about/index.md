# Everything about me
## About me
I am Kenny Hui (Better known as LX86). I sometimes code stuff, whether you like it or not.
I like and hate technologies, and I am not a fan of mainstream social media.<br>
Coming from Hong Kong, now supposedly <code>{{ metadata.bday | yearDiff }}</code> y/o.

If I sounds familiar to you then that's probably because I had taken part in lots of communities (e.g. Minecraft Transit Railway, OpenBVE). However as time passes I am just not as interested or not wanting to be involved on most of them for various reasons.

Leave me alone and let me work on my small personal projects :D.

For work I've done so far please check out my [main site](//lx862.com) because that's probably the only useful content on my main page.

## About this blog
This is a place where I, may, occasionally, post rambles and stuff.
I might also start considering posting short posts, as I am really bad at formulating long writings, and there are just many small blips in my life that I don't get to cover.

This blog is originally based on Beautiful Jekyll hosted on GitHub page, but later moved to Eleventy for performant reason. (And also slightly more familiarity)
